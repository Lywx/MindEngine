1. Fixed this element / hierarchical event driven ui 

    Task 1. Button: The simplest widget!

2. IMMElementExtension.cs: this is so bad!

3. AssetManager

    Note 1. I need to finish UI framework before I could finish the asset system
    because I currently have no idea how to construct the package system /
    how to dynamically load / reload design information
 
    Seperation of Settings of Texture and Settings in use of String of Texture name

4. Hot Update for Engine / Session Settings

5. Interop.Process namespace may be problematic and need cleaning

6. How to implement screen transition effect in this screen director and how should you handle Node.OnEnter / OnExit / OnExitTransition
